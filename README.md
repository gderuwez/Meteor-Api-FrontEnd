## Specifications :
Creation on a rest api based upon data got from [this site](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets#nasa).

## Our response:
-Using after getting the initial data, I imported it into a firebase realtime database and then developped a REST api for it using express.
-The api was then hosted on [heroku](https://limitless-peak-14538.herokuapp.com/meteor/).
-Once the Api was made I then used vue to devellop a separate front end to connect with the api.


## Our difficulties :
-Learning to devellop a rest api as well as facing the somewhat poorly made documentation from axios
